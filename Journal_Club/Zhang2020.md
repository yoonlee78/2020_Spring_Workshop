Theory of Robot Mind: Fasle Belief Attribution to Social Robots in Children With and Without Autism
Zhang et al., Frontiers in Psychology, 2020

Summary: 

- Participants: ASD children vs typically developing (TD) children
- false belief task and unexpected-contents task
- social robot - NAO

Results: 

- ASD childrens failed to detect NAO's intention, while TD children showed high accuracy
- ASD childrens perceived NAO as toy (50%), machine (20%), human (20%), and animal type (10%) respectively, while
TD children perceived 40, 40, 10, 10% respectively. 
- discussion  : because children watched introductive video about robots (in familiarization stage) their perception of 
social robot as more 'human-like' could have affected. 
- future studies could condider diffential effect of watching robot in passive way and in interactive way (watching robots playing vs playing with robots)
