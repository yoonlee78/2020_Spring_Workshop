Recent Advances and New Directions in Measuring ToM in Autistic Adults <br>

### Summary <br>

- Previous research on ToM mainly targeted children with ASD, less experimental research on adults with ASD <br>
- measuring ToM in adults with ASD <br>
	explicit vs implicit measures  <br>
	different from children, emotional intelligence, and cognitive skills <br>
- recent advances in computerised paradigm <br>
- video clips of social situations, mental state inference in 'real' social situations [(Murray et al 2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28296216)

### Meaning <br>

New directions:
- abbreviated tasks for larger samples <br>
- online tasks for those who are remote from the lab or with handicaps <br>
- alternative to verbal responese => written responses (text) <br>
- web-based tasks <br>
- realistic interaction using VR <br> 
- need more basic ToM research as not ALL ASD adults have impaired ToM <br> 
- need for designs reflecting mental state inference in ‘real’ social situations. (possibly e.g., VQA?) <br>

### Limitations <br>

Other indicators than RT should be proposed. For example, intentions and desires can be extracted from Text. <br>
Need suggestions for other tools such as Chatbot-based therapy?
