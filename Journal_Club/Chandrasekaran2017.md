Summary: 
- Human should learn AI’s theory of mind to collaborate with AI<br>
- Viki, VQA model<br>
- Asked human teammates (AMT subjects) to predict Failure Prediction and Knowledge Prediction<br>
- FP: we show AMT subjects an image and a question about the image, and ask them to estimate if Viki will correctly answer the question<br>
- KP: subjects are asked to estimate Vicki’s exact response. <br>
- familiarized them with Vicki’s actual beahaviour during a training phase<br>

Comments:
- Exposed them to Vicki’s internal states via several existing ’explanation’ modalities.<br>
- People quickly learned Vicki’s performance <br>
- Explanation modalities did not help people to predict Vicki’s performance <br>
- The authors stated that people tended to overfit to the Vicki’s explanatory modules, but I think they were simply distracting and did not help. <br>
- Theory of mind is not well defined and stated in this literature. Where is Vicki’s desire, belief, intention? Only stating vicki’s visual map of others does not help people to deduce higher level of cognitions.<br>
